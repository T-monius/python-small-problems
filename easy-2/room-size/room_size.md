# How big is the room?

## Problem

Build a program that asks a user for the length and width of a room in meters and then displays the area of the room in both square meters and square feet.

Note: 1 square meter == 10.7639 square feet

Do not worry about validating the input at this time.

### Understanding

Input
- Length
- Width
Output
- Area

## Examples / Test Cases

Enter the length of the room in meters:
10
Enter the width of the room in meters:
7
The area of the room is 70.0 square meters (753.47 square feet).

## Algorithm

1. Declare a variable for continuing to prompt or not
2. Loop
3. Prompt user for length
	- Inform of quit option
4. Promp for width
5. Coerce str inputs to integers
6. Multiply length by width
7. Output area
