# Mad Libs

## Problem

Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.

### Understanding

Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!
```
